        <h3>Web Development</h3>
        <p>
          Goatstone is primarily but not exclusively, Jose Collas. Here you will find a collection of some of our
          work. Goatstone is involved in web development, primarily using the technologies: JavaScipt, CSS, and HTML.

            lately.
        </p>
        <p>
          I have also been working with generating styles with JavaScript, D3 Interpolators, and JSS. I hope to work
          more with this strategy and see what more could be done with it.

            Minhooks is an attempt to represent the React hooks API in a minimal but functional way. Ideally, this will
            provide a resource for future development.
            I have incorporated the work I have done in the Minhooks repository into the D3Frame repository.

              Ameb was an entry into the JS13kGames JavaScript competition. Ameb must eat food in order to accumulate

              The player of Ameb navigates the character, Ameb, to catch food.
